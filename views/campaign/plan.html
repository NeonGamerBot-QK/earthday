              <div>
                <p>
                    Our ideas are to make birdhouses out of Recycled plastic, Cardboard, Leaves + twigs and glue.
                </p>
                <p class="mt-2">
The general idea is to make an  advisory birdhouse for each advisory.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Our research will include what the best recycled materials would be to use.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The plan for our earth day activity is for each advisory makes bird houses 
                </p>
                <h3>Our resources</h3>
                <p>The resources we will use includes: Recycled plastic.
                    Cardboard.
                    Leaves, twigs 
                  and  glue
                    </p>
                    <p>To buy all any of the materials it shall cost 0$</p>
                    <p>Cardboard - we can collect it over the next 2 months
                        Recycled plastic - we can collect it
                        Everything else - we already have it at school/we can collect it</p>
                        <h3>Planning</h3>
                        <p>
                            The planning that would need to be done ahead of time would be setting of the material in adviser.
                            The activity will take 45 mins.
                        </p>
                        <p>This event will take 
                            35 min building and 
                            10 min show & see.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Logistics</h3>
                            <p>
                                This activity uses recycled materials students/teachers bring in to build a birdhouse, which will actually be used 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                the groups will be broken down by advisee.
                            </p>
                            <br />
                            <p>
                                Over the next 2 months leading up to earth day week, there will be a project of people bringing in cardboard, recyclable plastic, etcâ€¦ (other materials needed to build the birdhouses).
There will be a competition of which advisory brings in the most materials
